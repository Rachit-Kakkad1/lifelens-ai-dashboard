## 🚀 The Vision
> *"What if your daily habits could heal you and the planet simultaneously?"*

We mostly treat health and sustainability as separate goals. **LifeLens** proves they are the same. By tracking simple daily inputs, our **Gemini-powered engine** reveals hidden correlations—showing how cycling to work not only reduces 2.5kg of CO2 but boosts your predicted energy levels by 18%.
